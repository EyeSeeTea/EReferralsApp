The eReferrals application is a simple and elegant open-source mobile application designed to refer patients from outside a health facility, to receive a concrete treatment as well as for their follow-up process. 

This application is intended to be used by healthcare community workers in the field after they have identified a potential user. Once the application is downloaded, no internet connection is needed to enter new vouchers. 

The application is based on the [QoC application](https://github.com/EyeSeeTea/malariapp) which allows to issue automatic generated surveys and retrieve and push information to a wide range of platform such as DHIS2 servers.
